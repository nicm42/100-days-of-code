# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: 23rd February 2019
Progress: Completed Flexbox Froggy (http://flexboxfroggy.com/) and Grid Garden (http://cssgridgarden.com/)
Completed the Git section of Web Development 101 at www.theodinproject.com
Completed the Learning git course on CodeAcademy.

Thoughts: These really helped me to understand CSS flexbox and CSS grids, what you can do with them and how you can use them.
I knew how Git and GitHub worked, but it was interesting to hear the history
I still don't 100% get going back but I think it's harder to visualise from the command line and will make more sense in a Git GUI.

Link to work: First one is only visible from my browser. Second one is only visible if you're logged in as me.

Day 2: 24th February 2019
Progress: Started a website to play around with CSS Flexbox to make sure I understand it. Only done the html so far.

Thoughts: I own a lot more of The Bill cast cards than I remember!

Day 3: 27th February 2019
Progress: Worked through some more of the freeCcodeCamp Javascript section.

Thoughts: Some of it was really basic. Some of it explained things I've used, but never knew about, so that was really useful.

Day 4: 1st March 2019
Progress: Finally finished the freeCodeCamp section.

Thoughts: Most of it I knew, although I really rely on code completion for for loops and hotstrings for ternary operators. The JSON challenges showed me that I hadn't remembered those sections as well as I thought, I had. I understand it all better now, though.

Day 5: 3rd March 2019
Progress: Did some more work on The Bill in Doctor Who page.

Thoughts: It's not been as useful as I thought it would be. I think I need to do something else that would have more going on, so I can play about with more CSS.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/the-bill-in-doctor-who


Day 6: 4th March 2019
Progress: Had an idea about a tribute page to use CSS Flex and Grid a bit more. Started on it, with some html, some information and some CSS.

Thoughts: I'm still trying to get my head round which is best to use where. Now I've done an overview of the whole thing, I need to work on individual bits next.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/tribute


Day 7: 6th March 2019
Progress: Did nearly half of the ES6 section on freeCcodeCamp.

Thoughts: It was slow going because I've vaguely seen arrow functions before, but never used any of the rest. And it turns out that some of the things you need to use in challenges will get taught later. And some of them fail if you leave comments in.

Link to work: freeCodeCamp profile: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 8: 8th March 2019
Progress: Finished off the ES6 section on freeCcodeCamp. Played chapter 2 on Flexbox Zombies

Thoughts: ES6 was hard. I think once I've done the Javascript section I will have to go back through it. Flexbox Zombies made me finally get the difference between space-around and space-between into my brain.

Link to work: freeCodeCamp profile: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 9: 9th March 2019
Progress: Worked on the CSS of my tribute page, updating CSS grid and addnig some colours, padding and margins. Completed chapter 3 of Flexbox Zombies. Started on freeCcodeCamp regular expressions section.

Thoughts: Went back to freeCcodeCamp and got my head around CSS grid. I think I now have which direction justify-content and align-items go in my head. I've use regular expressions before but never looked into them, so working through them is really interesting.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/tribute and freeCodeCamp profile: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 10: 10th March 2019
Progress: Played with the timeline unordered list on my tribute page. Worked through some more of the freeCcodeCamp regular expressions section. Completed chapter 4 of Flexbox Zombies.

Thoughts: Styling lists in css is really cool. However, what I thought of doing with it turns out to be quite complicated. Regular expressions continue to be interesting. Flexbox Zombies continues to be fun and helping me learn CSS Flexbox.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/tribute and freeCodeCamp profile: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 11: 11th March 2019
Progress: Completed the regular expressions section on freeCcodeCamp. Completed chapter 5 of Flexbox Zombies. Finished off the tribute page for computer-sized screens.

Thoughts: Regular expressions are hard! I kept having to check the forum for explanations of the correct answer. I think this is something that needs a lot of repetition to get in my head. I now understand flex-grow.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/tribute and freeCodeCamp profile: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42 


Day 12: 12th March 2019
Progress: Thought of some more to do on the tribute page for computers layout. Completed chapter 6 of Flexbox Zombies.

Thoughts: Trying to work out flex-grow and flex-shrink ratios is hard.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/tribute


Day 13: 13th March 2019
Progress: Completed chapter 7 of Flexbox Zombies. Did my first kata on Codewars.

Thoughts: Although I get flex-basis now, I'm not sure what it would be useful for (except Zombies). The Codewars kata was hard, although part of that was getting into how the site worked. I definitely need more practice at Javascript, so it should be handy, even just doing one a week.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42/completed


Day 14: 14th March 2019
Progress: Completed the debugging section on freeCcodeCamp. Completed chapter 8 of Flexbox Zombies. Did the mobile-specific bits of the tribute page.

Thoughts: Aside from one thing, the debugging things I already knew as I've already made all those errors! order on Flexbox Zombies drove me a bit mad as one challenge was only correct when order was 0, 1, 2, even though it looked right (and is effectively the same order as 1, 2, 3). I need to look at the tribute page on an actual mobile screen, but it seems like it all works. It just looks a bit sparse, despite having plenty of stuff on it.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/tribute and freeCodeCamp profile: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42 
 

Day 15: 15th March 2019
Progress: Completed chapters 9 & 10 of Flexbox Zombies. Got quite far through the freeCodeCamp Basic Data Structures section.

Thoughts: So many different flex options! At least wrapping is eeasy to spot. So far I know all of teh basic data structures section, except one thing which was covered in the ES6 section.

Link to work: freeCodeCamp profile: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 16: 16th March 2019
Progress: Completed Flexbox Zombies. Completed Basic Data Structures in freeCodeCamp. Finished my tribute page.

Thoughts: The final chapter of Flexbox Zombies wasn't as hard as I feared it would be. The rest of Basic Data Structures was stuff that was covered at the end of the basic javascript section. It's amazing how less amateur my site looks with some background gradients.

Day 17: 17th March 2019
Progress: Went back to The Bill in Doctor Who, finished it off and created Doctor Who in The Bill page.

Thoughts: It wasn't as bad as I first thought when I abandoned it, and didn't need much work to finish it off.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/the-bill-and-doctor-who


Day 18: 18th March 2019
Progress: Did some of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges on freeCodeCamp.

Thoughts: They aren't much harder than anything else I've done, but have been good for getting stuff in my head.

Link to work: freeCodeCamp profile: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 19: 24th March 2019
Progress: Nearly finished the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges on freeCcodeCamp.

Thoughts: They are getting harder, so I've been enjoying the challenge.

Link to work: freeCodeCamp profile: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 20: 25th March 2019
Progress: Finished the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges on freeCcodeCamp and started Object Oriented Programming.

Thoughts: That last challenge was a lot easier when starting fresh. OOP starts off with the same things we've done twice before!

Link to work: freeCodeCamp profile: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 21: 29th March 2019
Progress: Did a few code wars katas to level up to 7yu and some more of freeCcodeCamp OOP.

Thoughts: OOP is getting hard to grasp - I think I really need more examples. It might become clearer as I do more. 7yu katas are much easier than 6yu!

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42/completed and https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 22: 30th Marh 2019
Progress: Finished freeCcodeCamp OOP.

Thoughts: I get it, but I feel like I need more real-life examples of where you'd use it all.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 23: 31st March 2019
Progress: Did all of freeCcodeCamp functional programming

Thoughts: Now I understand some of the earlier stuff better.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 24: 1st April 2019
Progress: Did 4 of the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges.

Thoughts: They started off by being harder, but not too hard. Until the fourth one, which took me ages to get my head round.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 25: 2nd April 2019
Progress: Started on the Spinal Tap Case challenge on freeCodeCamp. Did some HackerRank challenges.

Thoughts: These intermediate challenges are hard!

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42 and https://www.hackerrank.com/nicm42


Day 26: 3rd April 2019
Progress: Finished the Spinal Tap Case challenge on freeCcodeCamp. Did an easy HackerRank challenge for some light relief. Did this week's CodeWars email 7kyu Kata.

Thoughts: Just as I shut my laptop down to go to work, I realised the solution to the FCC challenge. And it worked! The CodeWars kata was hardest on the maths! I didn't do it the most efficient way, but it wasn't too hard, so perhaps I need to try more 6ku ones.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42/completed and https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42 and https://www.hackerrank.com/nicm42


Day 27: 4th April 2019
Progress: Did three easy HackerRank challenges.

Thoughts: I only had 15 minutes, so these fit in nicely.

Link to work: https://www.hackerrank.com/nicm42


Day 28: 5th April 2019
Progress: Did an easy challenge on HackerRank. Then picked a problem solving one and did that.

Thoughts: Another chance to practise reduce, in the problem solving.

Link to work: https://www.hackerrank.com/nicm42


Day 29: 6th April 2019
Progress: Learnt about try and catch on HackerRank. Did two algorithms on freeCcodeCamp. Did day 1 of Wes Bos's Javascript30.

Thoughts: Try and catch was new to me and useful. Those two algorithms I found much simpler. Javascript30 was short and simple and pretty much consisted of things I didn't know, but are really useful to know.

Link to work: https://www.hackerrank.com/nicm42 and https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42 and https://github.com/nicm42/Javascript30


Day 30: 7th April 2019
Progress: Did five algorithm challenges on freeCcodeCamp and four of the Javascript10 ones on HackerRank.

Thoughts: The algorithm challenges have got easier - not easy, but a nice challenge. The HackerRank ones were more things I didn't know or needed to revise, which was good.

Link to work: https://www.hackerrank.com/nicm42 and https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 31: 8th April 2019
Progress: Completed one algorithm challenge on freeCodeCamp and started another. Did one of the Javascript10 challenges on HackerRank and started 30 days of code.

Thoughts: the algorithms got quite mathsy, so I had to go away and think about the one I started. The HackerRank bits have got hard to get my head round.

Link to work: https://www.hackerrank.com/nicm42 and https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 32: 9th April 2019
Progress: Realised how to do the maths bit of the algorithm and finished it off. Did another day of 30 days of code on HackerRank. Updated my readmes on my tribute page and The Bill and Doctor Who.

Thoughts: 30 days of code started off so easy and then suddenly went hard, even though they were about something easy!

Link to work: https://www.hackerrank.com/nicm42 and https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 33: 10th April 2019
Progress: Tried a Codewars kata. I did it in two different ways, but both of them took too long for the big tests. Did a freeCcodeCamp algorithm that was much quicker. Did another day of 30 days of code on HackerRank.

Thoughts: The Codewars thing was annoying. I just couldn't think how else to do it. And then the freeCcodeCamp one was easy in comparison. I might stop the 30 days of code on HackerRank because it's all simple stuff designed for people who have never done any coding before.

Day 34: 11th April 2019
Progress: Went through all of the jQuery section on freeCcodeCamp.

Thoughts: That was very basic and limited, I thought. But it reminded me of some things that I've forgotten existed. But a change from algorithms, which I dreamt about.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 35: 12th April 2019
Progress: Did three algorithms on freeCcodeCamp!

Thoughts: At first they all looked impossible. But I followed the links in the hints and googled some stuff and found they were not that bad at all.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 36: 13th April 2019
Progress: Finished off the intermediate algorithms on freeCcodeCamp. Also went through CSS Diner.

Thoughts: The algorithms suddenly got a lot easier. I didn't know how much I didn't know about CSS selectors. But I know now!

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 37: 14th April 2019
Progress: Did four of the Javascript projects.

Thoughts: The first one was easy, but then they got progressively harder.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 38: 15th April 2019
Progress: Got partway through the final Javascript project.

Thoughts: There is a lot going on in this one. My head hurts after an hour of it, but hopefully it will be easier after a break.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 39: 16th April 2019
Progress: Finished the final Javascript project

Thoughts: That was hard - it took me about three hours in total. I did keep complicating it and found I could simplify quite a bit. But I am so glad to be done and so proud to have done it. And finished the whole Javascript section in two days under two months.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 40: 17th April 2019
Progress: Did a 7kyu and a 6kyu kata on codewars.

Thoughts: I intended to take a day off from algorithms, thought I'd just do one and ended up doing two. I think they might be addictive.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42/completed


Day 41: 19th April 2019
Progress: Worked through DOM manipulation and events. Did day 2 of Wes Bos's Javascript30.

Thoughts: Now I get DOM manipulation and events. It's very similar to jQuery, it's just learning the exact syntax. I understood the DOM manipulation bits in the Javascript30 after doing that.

Link to work: Nothing to link.


Day 42:
Progress: Revised template literals and CSS animations and transitions. Learnt the CSS box model. Did a 6kyu kata on codewars. Started on a simple game to use CSS animations and JS DOM manipulation.

Thoughts: Now I get the difference between border-box and content-box. Those 6kyu katas are getting easier.

Link to work: W3C exercises and https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42/completed and https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 43:
Progress: Worked on the game and now have the basic functionality sorted.

Thoughts: I could do this all in jQuery so easily, but JS is just different enough that I keep having to look up everything I do. But then that was why I was doing this, after all.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 44:
Progress: Did an easy 7kyu kata on codewars to get it off my incomplete list. Worked on my game - have the basic structure down, just need to make some refinements.

Thoughts: Having a game that works is pretty cool! It shouldn't take too many more days to finish. I definitely need to do more 6kyu katas, although trying to do 7kyu ones efficiently is a good exercise if I don't have much time.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42/completed and https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 45:
Progress: Updated the game so it can start with a circle of any size.

Thoughts: An hour and I managed to achieve one thing. I just kept finding other things it impacted and needed to find other ways of doing things. However, I feel like I learnt a lot more than I have any other day working on it.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 46:
Progress: Added a reset button to the game.

Thoughts: Starting to feel like I've learnt my way around this stuff now. And really enjoying the game!

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 47:
Progress: Discovered codingame and completed 3 puzzles

Thoughts: It took me a while to understand the platform, but it's fun to use code and see how it changes the video.

Link to work: https://www.codingame.com/profile/7b3a5f483c1d1a240c8914fce895dc898958233


Day 48:
Progress: Did two codingame puzzles.

Thoughts: One was so easy I thought I was missing something. The other took a while.

Link to work: https://www.codingame.com/profile/7b3a5f483c1d1a240c8914fce895dc898958233


Day 49:
Progress: Finished the game!

Thoughts: That was harder for the week off. I have ideas for how to make it harder, but it's done its job with me getting to grips with DOM manipulation in JS.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 50:
Progress: Made a start on a Starfleet Recruitment website using LESS.

Thoughts: Spent most of my time sorting out Sublime Text to cope with LESS. After a re-install it can now not only cope with LESS, but doesn't give me errors all over the place. Spent the rest of the time looking up facts. But I have the basic structure down now, I just need to make it look pretty.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/starfleet-recruitment


Day 51:
Progress: Spent a lot of time working on images. But I have two of the sections largely done.

Thoughts: I hate image manipulation.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/starfleet-recruitment


Day 52:
Progress: Did Array Cardio 1 on Javascript30

Thoughts: It was really good to revise map, filter and reduce.

Link to work: Nothing to link.


Day 53:
Progress: Did a 7kyu kata on codewars - it was easy, but I learnt about converting objects to arrays. Did a few bits on the Starfleet website: set up navigation and did a bit on the carousel.

Thoughts: Object.entries is really useful!

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42/completed and https://github.com/nicm42/starfleet-recruitment


Day 54:
Progress: Did some work on the look of the Starfleet website.

Thoughts: It's looking better, but getting down to the harder bits now.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/starfleet-recruitment


Day 55:
Progress: Worked some more on the Starfleet website

Thoughts: I at last thought of something for the third section. It's just getting the complicated stuff working now, and it looking better.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/starfleet-recruitment


Day 56:
Progress: Have done most of the bits on the Starfleet website

Thoughts: So good to finally get the carousel sliding! Even if it's not 100% done yet.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/starfleet-recruitment


Day 57:
Progress: Finally finished the Starfleet site!

Thoughts: Slide the carousel so much it made me feel dizzy! But it was a good puzzle to get my head into.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/starfleet-recruitment


Day 58:
Progress: Discovered the hero image is broken in the Starfleet site, then found it's just codepen that doesn't like it. Got halfway through Bootstrap on freeCcodeCamp. Did two 7kyu katas on codewars.

Thoughts: That's half an hour of my life I'm never getting back. At least I know now that codepen and hero images don't play well together. Bootstrap is interesting so far, but I wonder how you know what to use. I'm out of practice at codewars, so 7kyu was about right, and The Office kata series are fun.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/starfleet-recruitment and https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42 and https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42/completed


Day 59:
Progress: Finished off the Bootstrap section and did the SASS section.

Thoughts: Bootstrap has some cool stuff, but I need to investigate more to see what I might actually use. SASS is a lot like LESS, with some extra bits that could be useful.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 60:
Progress: Started React on freeCcodeCamp, did a Javascript30 video, did a few katas on codewars.

Thoughts: React is... different. I can pretty much get the 7kyu katas down to 1 line, and 6kyu are getting easier, which is good.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42 and https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42/completed


Day 61:
Progress: Did 6 React challenges on freeCodeCamp. Then did some reading/writing demo to understand why React.

Thoughts: I understand something better if I understand why you'd use it. I think I am starting to get it and it is starting to feel less like learning a new language with a completely different character set.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 62:
Progress: Did 7 React challenges on freeCodeCamp, all on props. Did Ajax Type Ahead on Javascript30.

Thoughts: I feel like every time I come back to React I've forgotten everything. I just need to keep repeating it until it sinks in.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 63:
Progress: Did Array Cardio 2 on Javascipt30. Started the React tutorial on reactjs.org. Did 6 freeCcodeCamp challenges, all on state.

Thoughts: The array cardio was much simpler than the previous one and introduced me to a load of array stuff I've never come across before. It's really helping, doing the freeCcodeCamp and React tutorial in tandem.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 64:
Progress: Did 16 React challenges on freeCodeCamp. Did Fun with HTML5 canvas and 14 must know dev tools tricks on Javascript30.

Thoughts: Still finding React hard going.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42


Day 65:
Progress: Finished the React challenges on freeCcodeCamp. Did some more of the tutorial on reactjs.org

Thoughts: I'm definitely not confident enough to do any React on my own - I need to work through some more tutorials.

Link to work: https://www.freecodecamp.org/nicm42
