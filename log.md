# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: 23rd February 2018
Progress: Completed Flexbox Froggy (http://flexboxfroggy.com/) and Grid Garden (http://cssgridgarden.com/)
Completed the Git section of Web Development 101 at www.theodinproject.com
Completed the Learning git course on CodeAcademy.

Thoughts: These really helped me to understand CSS flexbox and CSS grids, what you can do with them and how you can use them.
I knew how Git and GitHub worked, but it was interesting to hear the history
I still don't 100% get going back but I think it's harder to visualise from the command line and will make more sense in a Git GUI.

Link to work: First one is only visible from my browser. Second one is only visible if you're logged in as me.
