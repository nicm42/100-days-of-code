# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: 23rd February 2019
Progress: Completed Flexbox Froggy (http://flexboxfroggy.com/) and Grid Garden (http://cssgridgarden.com/)
Completed the Git section of Web Development 101 at www.theodinproject.com
Completed the Learning git course on CodeAcademy.

Thoughts: These really helped me to understand CSS flexbox and CSS grids, what you can do with them and how you can use them.
I knew how Git and GitHub worked, but it was interesting to hear the history
I still don't 100% get going back but I think it's harder to visualise from the command line and will make more sense in a Git GUI.

Link to work: First one is only visible from my browser. Second one is only visible if you're logged in as me.

Day 2: 24th February 2019
Progress: Started a website to play around with CSS Flexbox to make sure I understand it. Only done the html so far.

Thoughts: I own a lot more of The Bill cast cards than I remember!

Day 3: 27th February 2019
Progress: Worked through some more of the freeCcodeCamp Javascript section.

Thoughts: Some of it was really basic. Some of it explained things I've used, but never knew about, so that was really useful.

Day 4: 1st March 2019
Progress: Finally finished the freeCodeCamp section.

Thoughts: Most of it I knew, although I really rely on code completion for for loops and hotstrings for ternary operators. The JSON challenges showed me that I hadn't remembered those sections as well as I thought, I had. I understand it all better now, though.

Day 5: 3rd March 2019
Progress: Did some more work on The Bill in Doctor Who page.

Thoughts: It's not been as useful as I thought it would be. I think I need to do something else that would have more going on, so I can play about with more CSS.

Day 6: 4th March 2019
Progress: Had an idea about a tribute page to use CSS Flex and Grid a bit more. Started on it, with some html, some information and some CSS.

Thoughts: I'm still trying to get my head round which is best to use where. Now I've done an overview of the whole thing, I need to work on individual bits next.

Day 7: 6th March 2019
Progress: Did nearly half of the ES6 section on freeCcodeCamp.

Thoughts: It was slow going because I've vaguely seen arrow functions before, but never used any of the rest. And it turns out that some of the things you need to use in challenges will get taught later. And some of them fail if you leave comments in.

Day 8: 8th March 2019
Progress: Finished off the ES6 section on freeCcodeCamp. Played chapter 2 on Flexbox Zombies

Thoughts: ES6 was hard. I think once I've done the Javascript section I will have to go back through it. Flexbox Zombies made me finally get the difference between space-around and space-between into my brain.

Day 9: 9th March 2019
Progress: Worked on the CSS of my tribute page, updating CSS grid and addnig some colours, padding and margins. Completed chapter 3 of Flexbox Zombies. Started on freeCcodeCamp regular expressions section.

Thoughts: Went back to freeCcodeCamp and got my head around CSS grid. I think I now have which direction justify-content and align-items go in my head. I've use regular expressions before but never looked into them, so working through them is really interesting.

Day 10: 10th March 2019
Progress: Played with the timeline unordered list on my tribute page. Worked through some more of the freeCcodeCamp regular expressions section. Completed chapter 4 of Flexbox Zombies.

Thoughts: Styling lists in css is really cool. However, what I thought of doing with it turns out to be quite complicated. Regular expressions continue to be interesting. Flexbox Zombies continues to be fun and helping me learn CSS Flexbox.

Day 11: 11th March 2019
Progress: Completed the regular expressions section on freeCcodeCamp. Completed chapter 5 of Flexbox Zombies. Finished off the tribute page for computer-sized screens.

Thoughts: Regular expressions are hard! I kept having to check the forum for explanations of the correct answer. I think this is something that needs a lot of repetition to get in my head. I now understand flex-grow.

Day 12: 12th March 2019
Progress: Thought of some more to do on the tribute page for computers layout. Completed chapter 6 of Flexbox Zombies.

Thoughts: Trying to work out flex-grow and flex-shrink ratios is hard.

Day 13: 13th March 2019
Progress: Completed chapter 7 of Flexbox Zombies. Did my first kata on Codewars.

Thoughts: Although I get flex-basis now, I'm not sure what it would be useful for (except Zombies). The Codewars kata was hard, although part of that was getting into how the site worked. I definitely need more practice at Javascript, so it should be handy, even just doing one a week.

Day 14: 14th March 2019
Progress: Completed the debugging section on freeCcodeCamp. Completed chapter 8 of Flexbox Zombies. Did the mobile-specific bits of the tribute page.

Thoughts: Aside from one thing, the debugging things I already knew as I've already made all those errors! order on Flexbox Zombies drove me a bit mad as one challenge was only correct when order was 0, 1, 2, even though it looked right (and is effectively the same order as 1, 2, 3). I need to look at the tribute page on an actual mobile screen, but it seems like it all works. It just looks a bit sparse, despite having plenty of stuff on it.

Day 15: 15th March 2019
Progress: Completed chapters 9 & 10 of Flexbox Zombies. Got quite far through the freeCodeCamp Basic Data Structures section.

Thoughts: So many different flex options! At least wrapping is eeasy to spot. So far I know all of teh basic data structures section, except one thing which was covered in the ES6 section.

Day 16: 16th March 2019
Progress: Completed Flexbox Zombies. Completed Basic Data Structures in freeCodeCamp. Finished my tribute page.

Thoughts: The final chapter of Flexbox Zombies wasn't as hard as I feared it would be. The rest of Basic Data Structures was stuff that was covered at the end of the basic javascript section. It's amazing how less amateur my site looks with some background gradients.
