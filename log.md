# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Day 1: 23rd February 2019
Progress: Completed Flexbox Froggy (http://flexboxfroggy.com/) and Grid Garden (http://cssgridgarden.com/)
Completed the Git section of Web Development 101 at www.theodinproject.com
Completed the Learning git course on CodeAcademy.

Thoughts: These really helped me to understand CSS flexbox and CSS grids, what you can do with them and how you can use them.
I knew how Git and GitHub worked, but it was interesting to hear the history
I still don't 100% get going back but I think it's harder to visualise from the command line and will make more sense in a Git GUI.

Link to work: First one is only visible from my browser. Second one is only visible if you're logged in as me.

Day 2: 24th February 2019
Progress: Started a website to play around with CSS Flexbox to make sure I understand it. Only done the html so far.

Thoughts: I own a lot more of The Bill cast cards than I remember!

Day 3: 27th February 2019
Progress: Worked through some more of the freeCcodeCamp Javascript section.

Thoughts: Some of it was really basic. Some of it explained things I've used, but never knew about, so that was really useful.

Day 4: 1st March 2019
Progress: Finally finished the freeCodeCamp section.

Thoughts: Most of it I knew, although I really rely on code completion for for loops and hotstrings for ternary operators. The JSON challenges showed me that I hadn't remembered those sections as well as I thought, I had. I understand it all better now, though.

Day 5: 3rd March 2019
Progress: Did some more work on The Bill in Doctor Who page.

Thoughts: It's not been as useful as I thought it would be. I think I need to do something else that would have more going on, so I can play about with more CSS.

Day 6: 4th March 2019
Progress: Had an idea about a tribute page to use CSS Flex and Grid a bit more. Started on it, with some html, some information and some CSS.

Thoughts: I'm still trying to get my head round which is best to use where. Now I've done an overview of the whole thing, I need to work on individual bits next.
