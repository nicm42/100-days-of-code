# 100 Days Of Code Round 2 - Log

Day 1: 1st February 2020
Progress: Did the Learn UI Design Fundamentals course on scrimba (https://scrimba.com/g/gdesign)

Thoughts: It was really interesting. I don't know if it's easier to see if something is terrible rather than just not great or I got better at spotting it as it went on.

Day 2: 2nd February 2020
Progress: Made a quick little site to say how long away this year's Grand Slams are, using jQuery.

Thoughts: Despite having used jQuery last month, I copy and paste so much I had to look up everything I did! Once I got into it, then it was fine.

Day 3: 3rd February 2020
Progress: Started a spaceship store landing page using Bootstrap.

Thoughts: The carousel is much easier to set up than doing it by hand. Although I won't really be able to finish it and make it look nice until I have all the content in there.

Day 4: 4th February 2020
Progress: Added some more Bootstrap to the spaceship store

Thoughts: I think I'm reading more than I'm coding, but then I expected that, as there's a lot of Bootstrap options. But it's pretty cool to just drop some HTML in and have it look pretty good straight away.

Day 5: 5th February 2020
Progress: Added some more Bootstrap to the spaceship store

Thoughts: It is starting to look pretty cool with pretty much nothing in the CSS. I just need to sort out some actual content!

Day 6: 6th February 2020
Progress: Added some more Bootstrap to the spaceship store

Thoughts: It is looking better the more content I add.

Day 7: 7th February 2020
Progress: Finished off the Bootstrap adding

Thoughts: I just need to make decisions about the look and come up with some images and text

Day 8: 8th February 2020
Progress: Finished off The Spaceship Store!

Thoughts: I like how I have a pretty cool looking site with no scripting that I needed to do and very little CSS.

Day 9: 9th February 2020
Progress: Did a 7kyu kata at codewars to get back into it, and tidied up my GitHub repositories and readmes.

Thoughts: It's going to take me a while to get back to 6kyu katas, never mind 5kyu ones.

Day 10: 10th February 2020
Progress: Added latest two projects to my portfolio

Thoughts: Now I'm happier that the sites I have in there are ones I'm proud of.

Day 11: 11th February 2020
Progress: Did the first lesson in the HTML5 canvas tutorial at Udacity.

Thoughts: I had no idea the things you could do with the canvas. It's pretty cool and I'm glad I have done a tutorial rather than reading through documents, because it's giving me a start to understand it.

Link to work: None


Day 12: 12th February 2020
Progress: I finished off the HTML5 canvas tutorial at Udacity

Thoughts: That got complicated quickly! But it was pretty cool. Now I just need to do something with te canvas.

Link to work: None


Day 13: 13th February 2020
Progress: I copied the RI Christmas Lectures fireworks and then improved them

Thoughts: It's been interesting how many different aspects of the canvas and Javascript in general that I've learnt/needed to use.

Day 14: 14th February 2020
Progress: Finished off the fireworks!

Thoughts: I just needed to repeat them, which I thought would be hard, but realised was easy.

Day 15: 15th February 2020
Progress: Started a landing page on Frontend Mentor

Thoughts: I thought it would be easier having the design and all the content, but there's a lot going on there and it's harder than I thought to think about how to do it.

Day 16: 16th February 2020
Progress: Worked on the landing page on Frontend Mentor

Thoughts: I'm glad I worked out all the class names in advance, given that putting them in to the HTML still took half an hour.

Day 17: 17th February 2020
Progress: I did one section of the landing page.

Thoughts: That took an hour and it was the easiest one. I think this is going to take a while.

Day 18: 18th February 2020
Progress: I did the build section for mobile.

Thoughts: It was fine and easy. And then I came to look at it for desktop and then realised I think CSS Grid would be better.

Day 19: 19th February 2020
Progress: I finished the build section.

Thoughts: It is much better in CSS grid. I definitely needded to revise CSS grid and it's pretty cool.
