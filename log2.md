# 100 Days Of Code Round 2 - Log

Day 1: 1st February 2020
Progress: Did the Learn UI Design Fundamentals course on scrimba (https://scrimba.com/g/gdesign)

Thoughts: It was really interesting. I don't know if it's easier to see if something is terrible rather than just not great or I got better at spotting it as it went on.

Link to work: None


Day 2: 2nd February 2020
Progress: Made a quick little site to say how long away this year's Grand Slams are, using jQuery.

Thoughts: Despite having used jQuery last month, I copy and paste so much I had to look up everything I did! Once I got into it, then it was fine.

Link to work: https://grand-slams.netlify.com/


Day 3: 3rd February 2020
Progress: Started a spaceship store landing page using Bootstrap.

Thoughts: The carousel is much easier to set up than doing it by hand. Although I won't really be able to finish it and make it look nice until I have all the content in there.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store


Day 4: 4th February 2020
Progress: Added some more Bootstrap to the spaceship store

Thoughts: I think I'm reading more than I'm coding, but then I expected that, as there's a lot of Bootstrap options. But it's pretty cool to just drop some HTML in and have it look pretty good straight away.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store


Day 5: 5th February 2020
Progress: Added some more Bootstrap to the spaceship store

Thoughts: It is starting to look pretty cool with pretty much nothing in the CSS. I just need to sort out some actual content!

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store


Day 6: 6th February 2020
Progress: Added some more Bootstrap to the spaceship store

Thoughts: It is looking better the more content I add.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store


Day 7: 7th February 2020
Progress: Finished off the Bootstrap adding

Thoughts: I just need to make decisions about the look and come up with some images and text

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store


Day 8: 8th February 2020
Progress: Finished off The Spaceship Store!

Thoughts: I like how I have a pretty cool looking site with no scripting that I needed to do and very little CSS.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store and https://spaceshipstore.netlify.com/


Day 9: 9th February 2020
Progress: Did a 7kyu kata at codewars to get back into it, and tidied up my GitHub repositories and readmes.

Thoughts: It's going to take me a while to get back to 6kyu katas, never mind 5kyu ones.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 10: 10th February 2020
Progress: Added latest two projects to my portfolio

Thoughts: Now I'm happier that the sites I have in there are ones I'm proud of.

Link to work: https://nicm42.github.io/


Day 11: 11th February 2020
Progress: Did the first lesson in the HTML5 canvas tutorial at Udacity.

Thoughts: I had no idea the things you could do with the canvas. It's pretty cool and I'm glad I have done a tutorial rather than reading through documents, because it's giving me a start to understand it.

Link to work: None


Day 12: 12th February 2020
Progress: I finished off the HTML5 canvas tutorial at Udacity

Thoughts: That got complicated quickly! But it was pretty cool. Now I just need to do something with te canvas.

Link to work: None


Day 13: 13th February 2020
Progress: I copied the RI Christmas Lectures fireworks and then improved them

Thoughts: It's been interesting how many different aspects of the canvas and Javascript in general that I've learnt/needed to use.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/fireworks


Day 14: 14th February 2020
Progress: Finished off the fireworks!

Thoughts: I just needed to repeat them, which I thought would be hard, but realised was easy.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/fireworks


Day 15: 15th February 2020
Progress: Started a landing page on Frontend Mentor

Thoughts: I thought it would be easier having the design and all the content, but there's a lot going on there and it's harder than I thought to think about how to do it.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 16: 16th February 2020
Progress: Worked on the landing page on Frontend Mentor

Thoughts: I'm glad I worked out all the class names in advance, given that putting them in to the HTML still took half an hour.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 17: 17th February 2020
Progress: I did one section of the landing page.

Thoughts: That took an hour and it was the easiest one. I think this is going to take a while.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 18: 18th February 2020
Progress: I did the build section for mobile.

Thoughts: It was fine and easy. And then I came to look at it for desktop and then realised I think CSS Grid would be better.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 19: 19th February 2020
Progress: I finished the build section.

Thoughts: It is much better in CSS grid. I definitely needded to revise CSS grid and it's pretty cool.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 20: 20th February 2020
Progress: Done most of the different section for mobile.

Thoughts: Every time I think I've got something I find there's something additional about it that makes it hard. Which is frustrating, but good because it means I'm learning loads.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 21: 21st February 2020
Progress: Done most of the different section for desktop.

Thoughts: I had a worry that I'd done the whole thing fundamentally wrong from the start, but actually I think it's fine, I just need to sort my SCSS out and use some more variables.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 22: 22nd February 2020
Progress: Finished off the different section and did most of the testimonials section.

Thoughts: The testimonials section was a lot simpler than I thought it would be. Although I have to add a script so you can get to the other testimonials. I also realised that the sections don't line up in other browser sizes, so I will have to go back and re-do them all the same way with the same padding/margins etc. But that's a job for another day.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 23: 23rd February 2020
Progress: Started revising the build, different and simplify sections so they all line up.

Thoughts: I tried a few things that didn't work and thought I'd found one that did, but then the simplify section isn't playing ball. I think I need to go away and come back to it and maybe it'll be easier.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 24: 24th February 2020
Progress: Finishing revamping the build, different and simplify sections.

Thoughts: That was much easier after coming back to it. I don't know what the problem was yesterday!

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 25: 25th February 2020
Progress: Mostly done the footer.

Thoughts: It took a while because I was grappling with CSS grid - I am definitely learning more about it. Which is good, since that's one of the things I wanted to do with this project.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 26: 26th February 2020
Progress: Finished off the last bits of the footer.

Thoughts: For some reason it's the little positioning bits that take the longest.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 27: 27th February 2020
Progress: Set up the header part.

Thoughts: I thought that was going to be a pain, but it was fine. At least for the CSS bit, I still have the Javascript to go...

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 28: 28th February 2020
Progress: Did the background images and the active states.

Thoughts: The background images were harder than I thought. But now all the CSS is done, it's just the scripting to go.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 29: 29th February 2020
Progress: Did the mobile navigation.

Thoughts: I did this on my own for my portfolio, but there are so many cool ways of doing it - it's much easier copying what other people have done (although I did combine three different methods).

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 30: 1st March 2020
Progress: Worked on the testimonials slider.

Thoughts: I went through a few variations until I was reminded of the interaction observer. One of the Javascript30 videos was a helpful reminder for dragging, even though the slider doesn't yet work as well as that demo. Hopefully it'll be obvious tomorrow.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 31: 2nd March 2020
Progress: Finished the testimonials slider.

Thoughts: Turned out to be the CSS that was interfering, of course.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 32: 3rd March 2020
Progress: Spent time looking inot using Babel to convert ES6.

Thoughts: Seems to be more complicated than I thought - possibly due to me trying this in the past and now ending up with a mess.

Link to work: None


Day 33: 4th March 2020
Progress: Did two katas in codewars, one 7kyu and one 6kyu

Thoughts: I found them both as hard, mainly because I spent the 7kyu one getting used to thinking about it. The 6kyu one was related, so I'd done most of the thinking already.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42/completed


Day 34: 5th March 2020
Progress: Did another Javascript30 tutorial.

Thoughts: Much as it was interesting, I can see it's out of date because there's now a better way of doing it.

Link to work: None


Day 35: 6th March 2020
Progress: Tested the Manage landing page on IE and played about with auto-prefixer and Gulp to fix it.

Thoughts: I am starting to get the hang of Gulp. The auto-prefixer only fixed some of the CSS grid problems, so that needs more work.

Link to work: None


Day 36: 7th March 2020
Progress: Finally got Gulp sorted with autoprefixer and babel.

Thoughts: That was hard work - Gulp changing versions recently and therefore needing writing differently was not a help.

Link to work: None


Day 37: 8th March 2020
Progress: Fixed all the IE11 problems.

Thoughts: IE is a pain. Although what took longer was installing and setting up SmartGit and Sublime Text on my Windows computer.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 38: 9th March 2020
Progress: Made a couple of changes to the Manage Landing Page based on feedback. Gave some feedback to a couple of solutions on Front End Mentor.

Thoughts: It is interesting seeing other people's solutions and how they do things. And hard with strangers to work out what level of feedback to give - how much to help with the solution.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page and https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/nicm42


Day 39: 10th March 2020
Progress: Added Gulp and the Manage Landing Page to Portfolio

Thoughts: Once I get the sequence of what I need to type into the Terminal down, then adding Gulp to things will get quicker...

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/nicm42.github.io


Day 40: 11th March 2020
Progress: Added Gulp to a few other projects that don't work properly on IE

Thoughts: Now I've got it down that was simple. I just have to establish whether they now work on IE or whether there's more work to do on them.

Link to work: 


Day 41: 12th March 2020
Progress: Done 4 7kyu katas

Thoughts: They're all on the theme about using higher-order functions, which I definitely need to practice - and these were easy to understand so I just had to work out which to use and how to use them.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 42: 14th March 2020
Progress: Done two 7kyu katas and a 6 kyu kata.

Thoughts: Still on the same theme - there are 17 of them in the collection, so they will take a while to get through.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 43: 15th March 2020
Progress: Did two 7kyu katas.

Thoughts: The second one took longer than it should because some of the answers should be false, but I couldn't see why - in the end I just had to attempt it so none of tests failed.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 44: 16th March 2020
Progress: Watched the previews for Scrimba's UI course and did a Discord JS bot tutorial.

Thoughts: I understand the basics of Discord bots now, but there's a lot more there to look into that could be interesting.

Link to work: None


Day 45: 17th March 2020
Progress: Continued with the series by doing two 7kyu and a 6kyu kata.

Thoughts: They weren't too bad - the 6kyu was helped by being similar to the last 6kyu one I did.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 46: 18th March 2020
Progress: Continued with the series by doing a 7kyu and a 6kyu kata.

Thoughts: The 6kyu was hard to get my head round, but I got there in the end. I started another 6kyu and took ages on it and can't solve it, so I'm going to come back to it tomorrow.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 47: 19th March 2020
Progress: Got the 6kyu kata done and did a 7kyu one.

Thoughts: I was over-complicating the 6kyu one yesterday. And found that once I had done I was still overcomplicating it. But I am so pleased to have got it working.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 48: 20th March 2020
Progress: Started the UI design bootcamp on Scrimba. Did a couple of 7kyu and an 8kyu kata on codewars.

Thoughts: The UI bootcamp mostly consisted of working out which bits I've already seen and watching some introductions. But it was thought-provoking and gives me ideas to improve my portfolio. The 7kyu katas were perfect for a short break from watching tutorials, but 8kyu is just too easy.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 49: 21st March 2020
Progress: Worked on some sites in my portfolio that don't work properly on IE.

Thoughts: Two of them just needed a bit of extra CSS. After spending ages on the other two I eventually discovered that I didn't have a .babelrc file so babel wasn't doing anything. And it needed updating. Hopefully tomorrow I can try them again and they will work better this time.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/


Day 50: 22nd March 2020
Progress: Spent some more time working on the two sites still not working in IE.

Thoughts: Spent the time fiddling about with babel (again). I have at least fixed one thing with one of them. The other just has a different error...

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/


Day 51: 23rd March 2020
Progress: Did the mobile First CSS lessons in UI Design Bootcamp on Scrimba.

Thoughts: It was interesting to see how he makes it look so good with just a few bits of css.

Link to work: None


Day 52: 25th March 2020
Progress: Finished off the mobile first CSS lessons in the UI Design Bootcamp.

Thoughts: For some reason getting the interface to resize the mini-browser and let me scroll was really hard today. It overshadowed the things I was learning.

Link to work: None


Day 53: 28th March 2020
Progress: Watched the responsive navigation lessons in the UI Dwsign Bootcamp.

Thoughts: Still struggling with the mini browser (and my browser crashing). This was stuff I already recently learnt, but it was good to get another reminder of how it's not as complicated as I used to think it was!

Link to work: None


Day 54: 29th March 2020
Progress: Read about localStorage and did a WesBox Javascript30 tutorial on it.

Thoughts: localStorage is a lot simpler than I thought it would be, and pretty cool.

Link to work: None


Day 55: 30th March 2020
Progress: Read about aria and Tailwind CSS.

Thoughts: They are both a lot to take in. I need to use them in order to understand them a bit more.

Link to work: None


Day 56: 31st March 2020
Progress: Did one of the Javascript30 tutorials about array references and copies.

Thoughts: That was really useful to know (just as long as I remember it!)

Link to work: None


Day 57: 1st April 2020
Progress: Did one of the Javascript30 tutorials about box shadow moving on mouse move.

Thoughts: It was interesting and fun. The main lesson was about x and y, which I've already spent time playing about with.

Link to work: None


Day 58: 2nd April 2020
Progress: Did one of the Javascript30 tutorials about custom video player controls.

Thoughts: I must have done this in jQuery years ago, so it's good to know what's possible in JavaScript these days.

Link to work: None


Day 59: 3rd April 2020
Progress: Did four of the Javascript30 tutorials.

Thoughts: As always, all useful stuff.

Link to work: None


Day 60: 4th April 2020
Progress: Started on v2 of Click the Dot with different shapes, high scores and using jQuery.

Thoughts: It's been hard to remember what I'm doing with jQuery when I've been so used to JavaScript when not at work.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 61: 5th April 2020
Progress: Worked on v2 of Click the Dot, now renamed to Click the Shape.

Thoughts: It's looking good, just needs a few tweaks and more browser testing.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 62: 6th April 2020
Progress: Did a Javascript30 tutorial on speech recognition.

Thoughts: It hadn't veen occured to me that you could do speech recognition on a computer. Or that it was so easy.

Link to work: None


Day 63: 7th April 2020
Progress: Did two Javascript30 tutorials, one one webcam and one on speech synthesis

Thoughts: Really interesting stuff. Not sure if I'll use it, but fun to learn anyway.

Link to work: None


Day 64: 8th April 2020
Progress: Did 4 Javascript30 tutorials and 2 7kyu and 1 6kyu katas in codewars.

Thoughts: The Javascript30 tutorials continue to be interesting and entertaining and I'm learning things from them. THe 7kyu katas were easy one to get me back into it. The 6kyu took me a long time to get my head around how to do the maths. 

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 65: 9th April 2020
Progress: Finished the last Javascript30 tutorials.

Thoughts: So pleased to have done them all! They've all had interesting things I can use.

Link to work: None


Day 66: 10th April 2020
Progress: Started on changing Click the Shape to use svg instead of CSS to create the shapes.

Thoughts: I am learning a lot about SVG, which was the whole point of doing it.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 67: 11th April 2020
Progress: Continued with Click the Shape

Thoughts: Learnt more about svg in getting the whole thing to work. Found styling the select easier to understand  I'd seen it on a real (simple) site.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 68: 12th April 2020
Progress: Did a load of things on Click the Shape

Thoughts: Learnt a lot about CSS and SASS best practices and aria.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 69: 13th April 2020
Progress: Finished Click the Shape

Thoughts: I learnt that localStorage doesn't work on IE and Edge unless it's on a server. Installing that turned out to be easy, eventually.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 70: 14th April 2020
Progress: Watched a video about rem and em, and also about choosing fonts.

Thoughts: Now I finally understand the difference between rem and em! Also, it was good to have some simple tricks for choosing fonts because it is hard to decide.

Link to work: None


Day 71: 15th April 2020
Progress: Did the third day of Conquering Responsive Layouts, and did two 8kyu, two 7kyu and a 6kyu kata on codewars.

Thoughts: Conquering Responsive Layouts has been good because it's thinhs I sort of know but haven't really had explained. I did a 7kyu kata to get into it, then the 6kyu kata on codewars didn't take me too long. I just had time for some 8kyu after that. I should do more 6kyu katas to get better at them.

Link to work: None


Day 72: 20th April 2020
Progress: Did today's Conquering Responsive Layouts. Then watched Kevin's video on psuedo-elements positioning with grids.

Thoughts: The flex stuff I knew, although not about gap. I definitely need to watch the series on pseudo elements, because I still find them a bit of a mystery.

Link to work: None
