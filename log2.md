# 100 Days Of Code Round 2 - Log

Day 1: 1st February 2020
Progress: Did the Learn UI Design Fundamentals course on scrimba (https://scrimba.com/g/gdesign)

Thoughts: It was really interesting. I don't know if it's easier to see if something is terrible rather than just not great or I got better at spotting it as it went on.

Link to work: None


Day 2: 2nd February 2020
Progress: Made a quick little site to say how long away this year's Grand Slams are, using jQuery.

Thoughts: Despite having used jQuery last month, I copy and paste so much I had to look up everything I did! Once I got into it, then it was fine.

Link to work: https://grand-slams.netlify.com/


Day 3: 3rd February 2020
Progress: Started a spaceship store landing page using Bootstrap.

Thoughts: The carousel is much easier to set up than doing it by hand. Although I won't really be able to finish it and make it look nice until I have all the content in there.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store


Day 4: 4th February 2020
Progress: Added some more Bootstrap to the spaceship store

Thoughts: I think I'm reading more than I'm coding, but then I expected that, as there's a lot of Bootstrap options. But it's pretty cool to just drop some HTML in and have it look pretty good straight away.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store


Day 5: 5th February 2020
Progress: Added some more Bootstrap to the spaceship store

Thoughts: It is starting to look pretty cool with pretty much nothing in the CSS. I just need to sort out some actual content!

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store


Day 6: 6th February 2020
Progress: Added some more Bootstrap to the spaceship store

Thoughts: It is looking better the more content I add.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store


Day 7: 7th February 2020
Progress: Finished off the Bootstrap adding

Thoughts: I just need to make decisions about the look and come up with some images and text

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store


Day 8: 8th February 2020
Progress: Finished off The Spaceship Store!

Thoughts: I like how I have a pretty cool looking site with no scripting that I needed to do and very little CSS.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store and https://spaceshipstore.netlify.com/


Day 9: 9th February 2020
Progress: Did a 7kyu kata at codewars to get back into it, and tidied up my GitHub repositories and readmes.

Thoughts: It's going to take me a while to get back to 6kyu katas, never mind 5kyu ones.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 10: 10th February 2020
Progress: Added latest two projects to my portfolio

Thoughts: Now I'm happier that the sites I have in there are ones I'm proud of.

Link to work: https://nicm42.github.io/


Day 11: 11th February 2020
Progress: Did the first lesson in the HTML5 canvas tutorial at Udacity.

Thoughts: I had no idea the things you could do with the canvas. It's pretty cool and I'm glad I have done a tutorial rather than reading through documents, because it's giving me a start to understand it.

Link to work: None


Day 12: 12th February 2020
Progress: I finished off the HTML5 canvas tutorial at Udacity

Thoughts: That got complicated quickly! But it was pretty cool. Now I just need to do something with te canvas.

Link to work: None


Day 13: 13th February 2020
Progress: I copied the RI Christmas Lectures fireworks and then improved them

Thoughts: It's been interesting how many different aspects of the canvas and Javascript in general that I've learnt/needed to use.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/fireworks


Day 14: 14th February 2020
Progress: Finished off the fireworks!

Thoughts: I just needed to repeat them, which I thought would be hard, but realised was easy.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/fireworks


Day 15: 15th February 2020
Progress: Started a landing page on Frontend Mentor

Thoughts: I thought it would be easier having the design and all the content, but there's a lot going on there and it's harder than I thought to think about how to do it.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 16: 16th February 2020
Progress: Worked on the landing page on Frontend Mentor

Thoughts: I'm glad I worked out all the class names in advance, given that putting them in to the HTML still took half an hour.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 17: 17th February 2020
Progress: I did one section of the landing page.

Thoughts: That took an hour and it was the easiest one. I think this is going to take a while.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 18: 18th February 2020
Progress: I did the build section for mobile.

Thoughts: It was fine and easy. And then I came to look at it for desktop and then realised I think CSS Grid would be better.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 19: 19th February 2020
Progress: I finished the build section.

Thoughts: It is much better in CSS grid. I definitely needded to revise CSS grid and it's pretty cool.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 20: 20th February 2020
Progress: Done most of the different section for mobile.

Thoughts: Every time I think I've got something I find there's something additional about it that makes it hard. Which is frustrating, but good because it means I'm learning loads.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 21: 21st February 2020
Progress: Done most of the different section for desktop.

Thoughts: I had a worry that I'd done the whole thing fundamentally wrong from the start, but actually I think it's fine, I just need to sort my SCSS out and use some more variables.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 22: 22nd February 2020
Progress: Finished off the different section and did most of the testimonials section.

Thoughts: The testimonials section was a lot simpler than I thought it would be. Although I have to add a script so you can get to the other testimonials. I also realised that the sections don't line up in other browser sizes, so I will have to go back and re-do them all the same way with the same padding/margins etc. But that's a job for another day.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 23: 23rd February 2020
Progress: Started revising the build, different and simplify sections so they all line up.

Thoughts: I tried a few things that didn't work and thought I'd found one that did, but then the simplify section isn't playing ball. I think I need to go away and come back to it and maybe it'll be easier.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 24: 24th February 2020
Progress: Finishing revamping the build, different and simplify sections.

Thoughts: That was much easier after coming back to it. I don't know what the problem was yesterday!

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 25: 25th February 2020
Progress: Mostly done the footer.

Thoughts: It took a while because I was grappling with CSS grid - I am definitely learning more about it. Which is good, since that's one of the things I wanted to do with this project.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 26: 26th February 2020
Progress: Finished off the last bits of the footer.

Thoughts: For some reason it's the little positioning bits that take the longest.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 27: 27th February 2020
Progress: Set up the header part.

Thoughts: I thought that was going to be a pain, but it was fine. At least for the CSS bit, I still have the Javascript to go...

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 28: 28th February 2020
Progress: Did the background images and the active states.

Thoughts: The background images were harder than I thought. But now all the CSS is done, it's just the scripting to go.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 29: 29th February 2020
Progress: Did the mobile navigation.

Thoughts: I did this on my own for my portfolio, but there are so many cool ways of doing it - it's much easier copying what other people have done (although I did combine three different methods).

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 30: 1st March 2020
Progress: Worked on the testimonials slider.

Thoughts: I went through a few variations until I was reminded of the interaction observer. One of the Javascript30 videos was a helpful reminder for dragging, even though the slider doesn't yet work as well as that demo. Hopefully it'll be obvious tomorrow.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 31: 2nd March 2020
Progress: Finished the testimonials slider.

Thoughts: Turned out to be the CSS that was interfering, of course.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 32: 3rd March 2020
Progress: Spent time looking inot using Babel to convert ES6.

Thoughts: Seems to be more complicated than I thought - possibly due to me trying this in the past and now ending up with a mess.

Link to work: None


Day 33: 4th March 2020
Progress: Did two katas in codewars, one 7kyu and one 6kyu

Thoughts: I found them both as hard, mainly because I spent the 7kyu one getting used to thinking about it. The 6kyu one was related, so I'd done most of the thinking already.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42/completed


Day 34: 5th March 2020
Progress: Did another Javascript30 tutorial.

Thoughts: Much as it was interesting, I can see it's out of date because there's now a better way of doing it.

Link to work: None


Day 35: 6th March 2020
Progress: Tested the Manage landing page on IE and played about with auto-prefixer and Gulp to fix it.

Thoughts: I am starting to get the hang of Gulp. The auto-prefixer only fixed some of the CSS grid problems, so that needs more work.

Link to work: None


Day 36: 7th March 2020
Progress: Finally got Gulp sorted with autoprefixer and babel.

Thoughts: That was hard work - Gulp changing versions recently and therefore needing writing differently was not a help.

Link to work: None


Day 37: 8th March 2020
Progress: Fixed all the IE11 problems.

Thoughts: IE is a pain. Although what took longer was installing and setting up SmartGit and Sublime Text on my Windows computer.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 38: 9th March 2020
Progress: Made a couple of changes to the Manage Landing Page based on feedback. Gave some feedback to a couple of solutions on Front End Mentor.

Thoughts: It is interesting seeing other people's solutions and how they do things. And hard with strangers to work out what level of feedback to give - how much to help with the solution.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page and https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/nicm42


Day 39: 10th March 2020
Progress: Added Gulp and the Manage Landing Page to Portfolio

Thoughts: Once I get the sequence of what I need to type into the Terminal down, then adding Gulp to things will get quicker...

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/nicm42.github.io


Day 40: 11th March 2020
Progress: Added Gulp to a few other projects that don't work properly on IE

Thoughts: Now I've got it down that was simple. I just have to establish whether they now work on IE or whether there's more work to do on them.

Link to work: 


Day 41: 12th March 2020
Progress: Done 4 7kyu katas

Thoughts: They're all on the theme about using higher-order functions, which I definitely need to practice - and these were easy to understand so I just had to work out which to use and how to use them.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 42: 14th March 2020
Progress: Done two 7kyu katas and a 6 kyu kata.

Thoughts: Still on the same theme - there are 17 of them in the collection, so they will take a while to get through.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 43: 15th March 2020
Progress: Did two 7kyu katas.

Thoughts: The second one took longer than it should because some of the answers should be false, but I couldn't see why - in the end I just had to attempt it so none of tests failed.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 44: 16th March 2020
Progress: Watched the previews for Scrimba's UI course and did a Discord JS bot tutorial.

Thoughts: I understand the basics of Discord bots now, but there's a lot more there to look into that could be interesting.

Link to work: None


Day 45: 17th March 2020
Progress: Continued with the series by doing two 7kyu and a 6kyu kata.

Thoughts: They weren't too bad - the 6kyu was helped by being similar to the last 6kyu one I did.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 46: 18th March 2020
Progress: Continued with the series by doing a 7kyu and a 6kyu kata.

Thoughts: The 6kyu was hard to get my head round, but I got there in the end. I started another 6kyu and took ages on it and can't solve it, so I'm going to come back to it tomorrow.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 47: 19th March 2020
Progress: Got the 6kyu kata done and did a 7kyu one.

Thoughts: I was over-complicating the 6kyu one yesterday. And found that once I had done I was still overcomplicating it. But I am so pleased to have got it working.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 48: 20th March 2020
Progress: Started the UI design bootcamp on Scrimba. Did a couple of 7kyu and an 8kyu kata on codewars.

Thoughts: The UI bootcamp mostly consisted of working out which bits I've already seen and watching some introductions. But it was thought-provoking and gives me ideas to improve my portfolio. The 7kyu katas were perfect for a short break from watching tutorials, but 8kyu is just too easy.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 49: 21st March 2020
Progress: Worked on some sites in my portfolio that don't work properly on IE.

Thoughts: Two of them just needed a bit of extra CSS. After spending ages on the other two I eventually discovered that I didn't have a .babelrc file so babel wasn't doing anything. And it needed updating. Hopefully tomorrow I can try them again and they will work better this time.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/


Day 50: 22nd March 2020
Progress: Spent some more time working on the two sites still not working in IE.

Thoughts: Spent the time fiddling about with babel (again). I have at least fixed one thing with one of them. The other just has a different error...

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/


Day 51: 23rd March 2020
Progress: Did the mobile First CSS lessons in UI Design Bootcamp on Scrimba.

Thoughts: It was interesting to see how he makes it look so good with just a few bits of css.

Link to work: None


Day 52: 25th March 2020
Progress: Finished off the mobile first CSS lessons in the UI Design Bootcamp.

Thoughts: For some reason getting the interface to resize the mini-browser and let me scroll was really hard today. It overshadowed the things I was learning.

Link to work: None


Day 53: 28th March 2020
Progress: Watched the responsive navigation lessons in the UI Dwsign Bootcamp.

Thoughts: Still struggling with the mini browser (and my browser crashing). This was stuff I already recently learnt, but it was good to get another reminder of how it's not as complicated as I used to think it was!

Link to work: None


Day 54: 29th March 2020
Progress: Read about localStorage and did a WesBox Javascript30 tutorial on it.

Thoughts: localStorage is a lot simpler than I thought it would be, and pretty cool.

Link to work: None


Day 55: 30th March 2020
Progress: Read about aria and Tailwind CSS.

Thoughts: They are both a lot to take in. I need to use them in order to understand them a bit more.

Link to work: None


Day 56: 31st March 2020
Progress: Did one of the Javascript30 tutorials about array references and copies.

Thoughts: That was really useful to know (just as long as I remember it!)

Link to work: None


Day 57: 1st April 2020
Progress: Did one of the Javascript30 tutorials about box shadow moving on mouse move.

Thoughts: It was interesting and fun. The main lesson was about x and y, which I've already spent time playing about with.

Link to work: None


Day 58: 2nd April 2020
Progress: Did one of the Javascript30 tutorials about custom video player controls.

Thoughts: I must have done this in jQuery years ago, so it's good to know what's possible in JavaScript these days.

Link to work: None


Day 59: 3rd April 2020
Progress: Did four of the Javascript30 tutorials.

Thoughts: As always, all useful stuff.

Link to work: None


Day 60: 4th April 2020
Progress: Started on v2 of Click the Dot with different shapes, high scores and using jQuery.

Thoughts: It's been hard to remember what I'm doing with jQuery when I've been so used to JavaScript when not at work.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 61: 5th April 2020
Progress: Worked on v2 of Click the Dot, now renamed to Click the Shape.

Thoughts: It's looking good, just needs a few tweaks and more browser testing.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 62: 6th April 2020
Progress: Did a Javascript30 tutorial on speech recognition.

Thoughts: It hadn't veen occured to me that you could do speech recognition on a computer. Or that it was so easy.

Link to work: None


Day 63: 7th April 2020
Progress: Did two Javascript30 tutorials, one one webcam and one on speech synthesis

Thoughts: Really interesting stuff. Not sure if I'll use it, but fun to learn anyway.

Link to work: None


Day 64: 8th April 2020
Progress: Did 4 Javascript30 tutorials and 2 7kyu and 1 6kyu katas in codewars.

Thoughts: The Javascript30 tutorials continue to be interesting and entertaining and I'm learning things from them. THe 7kyu katas were easy one to get me back into it. The 6kyu took me a long time to get my head around how to do the maths. 

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 65: 9th April 2020
Progress: Finished the last Javascript30 tutorials.

Thoughts: So pleased to have done them all! They've all had interesting things I can use.

Link to work: None


Day 66: 10th April 2020
Progress: Started on changing Click the Shape to use svg instead of CSS to create the shapes.

Thoughts: I am learning a lot about SVG, which was the whole point of doing it.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 67: 11th April 2020
Progress: Continued with Click the Shape

Thoughts: Learnt more about svg in getting the whole thing to work. Found styling the select easier to understand  I'd seen it on a real (simple) site.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 68: 12th April 2020
Progress: Did a load of things on Click the Shape

Thoughts: Learnt a lot about CSS and SASS best practices and aria.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 69: 13th April 2020
Progress: Finished Click the Shape

Thoughts: I learnt that localStorage doesn't work on IE and Edge unless it's on a server. Installing that turned out to be easy, eventually.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/clickthedot


Day 70: 14th April 2020
Progress: Watched a video about rem and em, and also about choosing fonts.

Thoughts: Now I finally understand the difference between rem and em! Also, it was good to have some simple tricks for choosing fonts because it is hard to decide.

Link to work: None


Day 71: 15th April 2020
Progress: Did the third day of Conquering Responsive Layouts, and did two 8kyu, two 7kyu and a 6kyu kata on codewars.

Thoughts: Conquering Responsive Layouts has been good because it's thinhs I sort of know but haven't really had explained. I did a 7kyu kata to get into it, then the 6kyu kata on codewars didn't take me too long. I just had time for some 8kyu after that. I should do more 6kyu katas to get better at them.

Link to work: None


Day 72: 20th April 2020
Progress: Did today's Conquering Responsive Layouts. Then watched Kevin's video on psuedo-elements positioning with grids.

Thoughts: The flex stuff I knew, although not about gap. I definitely need to watch the series on pseudo elements, because I still find them a bit of a mystery.

Link to work: None


Day 73: 21st April 2020
Progress: Did today's Conquering Responsive Layouts. Then watched part 1 of Kevin's video series on pseudo elements.

Thoughts: The flex stuff was all things I knew. It was good to have the pseudo elements basics explained.

Link to work: None


Day 74: 22nd April 2020
Progress: Watched part 2 of Kevin's video series on pseudo elements and a video about Emmet.

Thoughts: Emmet is really useful. And psuedo elements are really cool, you can do so much with them.

Link to work: None


Day 75: 23rd April 2020
Progress: Did today's Conquering Responsive Layouts. Then watched part 3 of Kevin's video series on pseudo elements, and a video on CSS transitions.

Thoughts: Today's was some very simple Flex. I really need to practice some pseudo-elements. Now I understand transitions a bit more - I also need to practice them.

Link to work: None


Day 76: 24th April 2020
Progress: Watched the videos on today's Conquering Responsive Layouts. Watched one of Kevin's videos on fun hover effects.

Thoughts: The challenge for today was more work than I had time for, so I've saved that for tomorrow. The hover effects video was almost a continuation from the pseudo elements one. After he did the first one, I could come up with the second on my own and most of the third on my own too. Although I still need to practice all of these things on my own project.

Link to work: None


Day 77: 25th April 2020
Progress: Did yesterday's challenge for Conquering Responsive Layouts.

Thoughts: That was easier than I thought. But it will be interesting to see if there's a better/different way of doing it and if there's anything I didn't think about.

Link to work: None


Day 78: 26th April 2020
Progress: Did four lessons in the UI Dwsign Bootcamp.

Thoughts: It's been a while since I've done anything on this and it was harder from not remembering the fundamentals as well as I thought I did.

Link to work: None


Day 79: 27th April 2020
Progress: Did today's Conquering Responsive Layout lesson. Watched videos on min(), max(), clamp() and @supports in CSS.

Thoughts: The @supports is really useful. The others are nice to get it a line of code, although it doesn't make as much difference if you use SASS.

Link to work: None


Day 80: 28th April 2020
Progress: Did today's Conquering Responsive Layout lesson and finished off the Whole Project Refactoring in the UI Design Bootcamp. I then did two 8kyu katas, two 6kyu katas anda  5kyu kata at codewars

Thoughts: The UI Design Bootcamp is hard to go back to. The Conquering Responsive Layout lesson on what breakpoints to choose for media queries was useful because I didn't really know. The two 8kyu katas were because codewars said I'd started them but not finished. The 6 and the 5kyu people said were easier than that and I didn't find them too hard - or too easy either.

Link to work: None


Day 81: 29th April 2020
Progress: Did today's Conquering Responsive Layout lesson and started on the Tea Project in the UI Design Bootcamp.

Thoughts: I found making a design easier than refactoring one, but I think some of the came from seeing the HTML written so I understood it, and I understood the hierarchy of the things on the page. Although we'll see tomorrow how my design matches up...

Link to work: None


Day 82: 30th April 2020
Progress: Did today's Conquering Responsive Layout lesson.

Thoughts: Going between Conquering Responsive Layouts and UI Bootcamp is confusing me because they have different ways of doing things. I will have to stick to one until I've finished it, then go back to the other (which is what I should be doing anyway).

Link to work: None


Day 83: 2nd May 2020
Progress: Did today and yesterday's Conquering Responsive Layout lesson.

Thoughts: That wasn't too hard, although I downloaded the files yesterday morning, so they didn't include the fix and it took me a little while to work out what was going on.

Link to work: None


Day 84: 3rd May 2020
Progress: Finished the Conquering Responsive Layout course. Did some of the Tailwind CSS course.

Thoughts: The final challenge took me a while, but I did see how much less code there was when you go mobile first. I'm liking the idea of Tailwind so far, it looks interesting. I am looking forward to learning more and trying it out.

Link to work: None


Day 85: 6th May 2020
Progress: Did most of the Tailwind CSS course.

Thoughts: The Tailwind CSS course was good to help me understand the basics. But it was very basic, so rather than finishing the last challenges, the best thing to do will be to use it.

Link to work: None


Day 86: 7th May 2020
Progress: Did some Gulp tutorials and investigated VS Code.

Thoughts: I am starting to understand Gulp more now, than I did when I just tried to copy files.

Link to work: None


Day 87: 8th May 2020
Progress: Started on a Frontend Mentor layout using Tailwind CSS and VS Code.

Thoughts: I like that VS code is coming up with Tailwind CSS suggestions. But typing HTML on it is so much harder than in Sublime Text. Tailwind CSS is fun so far - I picked an easy layout to try it out on.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/single-price-grid-component


Day 88: 9th May 2020
Progress: Carried on with the Frontend Mentor layout

Thoughts: I am liking Tailwind CSS less - I feel like I keep needing to add in variables that don't exist as standard. And it requires more looking things up (although once I used it enough it would probably need less). I can see its uses, but i feel like ordinary CSS is just going to be easier. I am liking the BrowserSync in Gulp, though.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/single-price-grid-component


Day 89: 10th May 2020
Progress: Finished the Frontend Mentor layout

Thoughts: Despite using Pixel Perfect extension to get it the same as the design, when I upload the solution screenshot shows it at a completely different size. No idea why.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/single-price-grid-component


Day 90: 11th May 2020
Progress: Started Wes Bos's CSS Grid course

Thoughts: I keep thinking I understand CSS Grid and then finding that I don't when I come to use it. So it's good that this course is starting from the basics.

Link to work: None


Day 91: 12th May 2020
Progress: Continued with Wes Bos's CSS Grid course. Also decided to look at CoffeeScript and do some katas on codewars.

Thoughts: This is really useful - there's lots of things in here I didn't really know about. CoffeeScript messes with my head!

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 92: 13th May 2020
Progress: Continued with Wes Bos's CSS Grid course

Thoughts: It's getting more complicated and it's into real-life stuff, but I am following it all, which is really good.

Link to work: None


Day 93: 14th May 2020
Progress: Finished Wes Bos's CSS Grid course

Thoughts: Now I just need to write something with a load of grids and see if it's easier now (I hope it is!)

Link to work: None


Day 94: 18th May 2020
Progress: Did the Figma tutorials in Figma and started watching some Figma tutorials on YouTube.

Thoughts: There's a lot going on in there, but the YouTube tutorials are helping.

Link to work: None


Day 95: 19th May 2020
Progress: Watched the videos about translating Figma design to code. Also gave some feedback on Frontend Mentor.

Thoughts: There wasn't a lot there about using Figma, but it was good to get an idea of how to go from design to code, and a refresher on CSS Grid in real life.

Day 96: 20th May 2020
Progress: Worked on my portfolio in Figma.

Thoughts: I feel like it's something you can endlessly tweak, easier than in CSS, and at some point I will have to stop and just code the thing.

Day 97: 21st May 2020
Progress: Did the mobile design for my profile and watched a coding video.

Thoughts: The mobile design was easy to copy from the desktop design. The coding video was really useful to see how to use all the aspects of SCSS, not just variables.

Day 98: 22nd May 2020
Progress: Started a Frontend Mentor site.

Thoughts: I did it to practice CSS Grid - I would definitely not have been able to do the grid on it before I did Wes Bos's course. And I didn't even have to look anything up! I also used Coder Coder's SCSS set up and it does make everything much easier to read.
