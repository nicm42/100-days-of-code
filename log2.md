# 100 Days Of Code Round 2 - Log

Day 1: 1st February 2020
Progress: Did the Learn UI Design Fundamentals course on scrimba (https://scrimba.com/g/gdesign)

Thoughts: It was really interesting. I don't know if it's easier to see if something is terrible rather than just not great or I got better at spotting it as it went on.

Link to work: None


Day 2: 2nd February 2020
Progress: Made a quick little site to say how long away this year's Grand Slams are, using jQuery.

Thoughts: Despite having used jQuery last month, I copy and paste so much I had to look up everything I did! Once I got into it, then it was fine.
