# 100 Days Of Code Round 2 - Log

Day 1: 1st February 2020
Progress: Did the Learn UI Design Fundamentals course on scrimba (https://scrimba.com/g/gdesign)

Thoughts: It was really interesting. I don't know if it's easier to see if something is terrible rather than just not great or I got better at spotting it as it went on.

Day 2: 2nd February 2020
Progress: Made a quick little site to say how long away this year's Grand Slams are, using jQuery.

Thoughts: Despite having used jQuery last month, I copy and paste so much I had to look up everything I did! Once I got into it, then it was fine.

Day 3: 3rd February 2020
Progress: Started a spaceship store landing page using Bootstrap.

Thoughts: The carousel is much easier to set up than doing it by hand. Although I won't really be able to finish it and make it look nice until I have all the content in there.

Day 4: 4th February 2020
Progress: Added some more Bootstrap to the spaceship store

Thoughts: I think I'm reading more than I'm coding, but then I expected that, as there's a lot of Bootstrap options. But it's pretty cool to just drop some HTML in and have it look pretty good straight away.

Day 5: 5th February 2020
Progress: Added some more Bootstrap to the spaceship store

Thoughts: It is starting to look pretty cool with pretty much nothing in the CSS. I just need to sort out some actual content!

Day 6: 6th February 2020
Progress: Added some more Bootstrap to the spaceship store

Thoughts: It is looking better the more content I add.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store


Day 7: 7th February 2020
Progress: Finished off the Bootstrap adding

Thoughts: I just need to make decisions about the look and come up with some images and text

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store


Day 8: 8th February 2020
Progress: Finished off The Spaceship Store!

Thoughts: I like how I have a pretty cool looking site with no scripting that I needed to do and very little CSS.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/spaceship-store and https://spaceshipstore.netlify.com/


Day 9: 9th February 2020
Progress: Did a 7kyu kata at codewars to get back into it, and tidied up my GitHub repositories and readmes.

Thoughts: It's going to take me a while to get back to 6kyu katas, never mind 5kyu ones.

Day 10: 10th February 2020
Progress: Added latest two projects to my portfolio

Thoughts: Now I'm happier that the sites I have in there are ones I'm proud of.

Day 11: 11th February 2020
Progress: Did the first lesson in the HTML5 canvas tutorial at Udacity.

Thoughts: I had no idea the things you could do with the canvas. It's pretty cool and I'm glad I have done a tutorial rather than reading through documents, because it's giving me a start to understand it.

Link to work: None


Day 12: 12th February 2020
Progress: I finished off the HTML5 canvas tutorial at Udacity

Thoughts: That got complicated quickly! But it was pretty cool. Now I just need to do something with te canvas.

Link to work: None


Day 13: 13th February 2020
Progress: I copied the RI Christmas Lectures fireworks and then improved them

Thoughts: It's been interesting how many different aspects of the canvas and Javascript in general that I've learnt/needed to use.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/fireworks


Day 14: 14th February 2020
Progress: Finished off the fireworks!

Thoughts: I just needed to repeat them, which I thought would be hard, but realised was easy.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/fireworks


Day 15: 15th February 2020
Progress: Started a landing page on Frontend Mentor

Thoughts: I thought it would be easier having the design and all the content, but there's a lot going on there and it's harder than I thought to think about how to do it.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 16: 16th February 2020
Progress: Worked on the landing page on Frontend Mentor

Thoughts: I'm glad I worked out all the class names in advance, given that putting them in to the HTML still took half an hour.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 17: 17th February 2020
Progress: I did one section of the landing page.

Thoughts: That took an hour and it was the easiest one. I think this is going to take a while.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 18: 18th February 2020
Progress: I did the build section for mobile.

Thoughts: It was fine and easy. And then I came to look at it for desktop and then realised I think CSS Grid would be better.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 19: 19th February 2020
Progress: I finished the build section.

Thoughts: It is much better in CSS grid. I definitely needded to revise CSS grid and it's pretty cool.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 20: 20th February 2020
Progress: Done most of the different section for mobile.

Thoughts: Every time I think I've got something I find there's something additional about it that makes it hard. Which is frustrating, but good because it means I'm learning loads.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 21: 21st February 2020
Progress: Done most of the different section for desktop.

Thoughts: I had a worry that I'd done the whole thing fundamentally wrong from the start, but actually I think it's fine, I just need to sort my SCSS out and use some more variables.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 22: 22nd February 2020
Progress: Finished off the different section and did most of the testimonials section.

Thoughts: The testimonials section was a lot simpler than I thought it would be. Although I have to add a script so you can get to the other testimonials. I also realised that the sections don't line up in other browser sizes, so I will have to go back and re-do them all the same way with the same padding/margins etc. But that's a job for another day.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 23: 23rd February 2020
Progress: Started revising the build, different and simplify sections so they all line up.

Thoughts: I tried a few things that didn't work and thought I'd found one that did, but then the simplify section isn't playing ball. I think I need to go away and come back to it and maybe it'll be easier.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 24: 24th February 2020
Progress: Finishing revamping the build, different and simplify sections.

Thoughts: That was much easier after coming back to it. I don't know what the problem was yesterday!

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 25: 25th February 2020
Progress: Mostly done the footer.

Thoughts: It took a while because I was grappling with CSS grid - I am definitely learning more about it. Which is good, since that's one of the things I wanted to do with this project.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 26: 26th February 2020
Progress: Finished off the last bits of the footer.

Thoughts: For some reason it's the little positioning bits that take the longest.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 27: 27th February 2020
Progress: Set up the header part.

Thoughts: I thought that was going to be a pain, but it was fine. At least for the CSS bit, I still have the Javascript to go...

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 28: 28th February 2020
Progress: Did the background images and the active states.

Thoughts: The background images were harder than I thought. But now all the CSS is done, it's just the scripting to go.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 29: 29th February 2020
Progress: Did the mobile navigation.

Thoughts: I did this on my own for my portfolio, but there are so many cool ways of doing it - it's much easier copying what other people have done (although I did combine three different methods).

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 30: 1st March 2020
Progress: Worked on the testimonials slider.

Thoughts: I went through a few variations until I was reminded of the interaction observer. One of the Javascript30 videos was a helpful reminder for dragging, even though the slider doesn't yet work as well as that demo. Hopefully it'll be obvious tomorrow.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 31: 2nd March 2020
Progress: Finished the testimonials slider.

Thoughts: Turned out to be the CSS that was interfering, of course.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 32: 3rd March 2020
Progress: Spent time looking inot using Babel to convert ES6.

Thoughts: Seems to be more complicated than I thought - possibly due to me trying this in the past and now ending up with a mess.

Link to work: None


Day 33: 4th March 2020
Progress: Did two katas in codewars, one 7kyu and one 6kyu

Thoughts: I found them both as hard, mainly because I spent the 7kyu one getting used to thinking about it. The 6kyu one was related, so I'd done most of the thinking already.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42/completed


Day 34: 5th March 2020
Progress: Did another Javascript30 tutorial.

Thoughts: Much as it was interesting, I can see it's out of date because there's now a better way of doing it.

Link to work: None


Day 35: 6th March 2020
Progress: Tested the Manage landing page on IE and played about with auto-prefixer and Gulp to fix it.

Thoughts: I am starting to get the hang of Gulp. The auto-prefixer only fixed some of the CSS grid problems, so that needs more work.

Link to work: None


Day 36: 7th March 2020
Progress: Finally got Gulp sorted with autoprefixer and babel.

Thoughts: That was hard work - Gulp changing versions recently and therefore needing writing differently was not a help.

Link to work: None


Day 37: 8th March 2020
Progress: Fixed all the IE11 problems.

Thoughts: IE is a pain. Although what took longer was installing and setting up SmartGit and Sublime Text on my Windows computer.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page


Day 38: 9th March 2020
Progress: Made a couple of changes to the Manage Landing Page based on feedback. Gave some feedback to a couple of solutions on Front End Mentor.

Thoughts: It is interesting seeing other people's solutions and how they do things. And hard with strangers to work out what level of feedback to give - how much to help with the solution.

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/Manage-Landing-Page and https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/nicm42


Day 39: 10th March 2020
Progress: Added Gulp and the Manage Landing Page to Portfolio

Thoughts: Once I get the sequence of what I need to type into the Terminal down, then adding Gulp to things will get quicker...

Link to work: https://github.com/nicm42/nicm42.github.io


Day 40: 11th March 2020
Progress: Added Gulp to a few other projects that don't work properly on IE

Thoughts: Now I've got it down that was simple. I just have to establish whether they now work on IE or whether there's more work to do on them.

Link to work: 


Day 41: 12th March 2020
Progress: Done 4 7kyu katas

Thoughts: They're all on the theme about using higher-order functions, which I definitely need to practice - and these were easy to understand so I just had to work out which to use and how to use them.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 42: 14th March 2020
Progress: Done two 7kyu katas and a 6 kyu kata.

Thoughts: Still on the same theme - there are 17 of them in the collection, so they will take a while to get through.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 43: 15th March 2020
Progress: Did two 7kyu katas.

Thoughts: The second one took longer than it should because some of the answers should be false, but I couldn't see why - in the end I just had to attempt it so none of tests failed.

Link to work: https://www.codewars.com/users/nicm42


Day 44: 16th March 2020
Progress: Watched the previews for Scrimba's UI course and did a Discord JS bot tutorial.

Thoughts: I understand the basics of Discord bots now, but there's a lot more there to look into that could be interesting.
